# Haskell Tensor Library

Some Haskell for manipulating tensors.

1. The tensor must be represented as a data type. It has to include both contravariant and covariant indices, and in any order. The tensors should be accessible in an intuitive way, consistent with the abstract index notation.
2. Functions (or alternative implementations) for basic algebra operations should be included. Including (but not exclusive) addition, tensor product, symmetrization, asymmetrization, index contraction, scalar operations.
3. Should have functions determining the equality of tensors, perhaps given by different definitions.
4. Shoule include functions for changing basis, showing the tensor in expanded basis form.
